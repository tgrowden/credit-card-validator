# Credit Card Validator

## About

This project is a Next.js app used to validate credit card numbers server-side: it uses the [Luhn algorithm](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Luhn_algorithm) to validate the input server-side.

The application includes examples of both React server actions and a more traditional API endpoint.

## Notes

Next.js version `13.4.9` is being used because Next.js version 14+ is [currently unsupported by Netlify](https://answers.netlify.com/t/issue-with-next-js-14-server-actions-on-netlify-404-error-on-post-request/107257)
